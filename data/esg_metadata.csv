A drought can lead to losses to agriculture, affect inland navigation and hydropower plants, and cause a lack of drinking water and famine. A flood is a significant rise of water level in a stream, lake, reservoir or coastal region. Extreme temperature events are either cold waves or heat waves. A cold wave can be both a prolonged period of excessively cold weather and the sudden invasion of very cold air over a large area. Along with frost it can cause damage to agriculture, infrastructure, and property. A heat wave is a prolonged period of excessively hot and sometimes also humid weather relative to normal climate patterns of a certain region.

These questions focus on the public availability of eight key budget documents (with a particular emphasis on the ExecutiveÀ_À_À_s Budget Proposal), and on the information they contain. A score of 81-100 indicates that a given country provides extensive information in its budget documents, a score of 61-80 indicates significant information, 41-60 indicates some  information, 21-40 indicates minimal information, and zero-20 indicates scant or no information. The Open Budget Index rates countries on how open their budget books are to their citizens. The Index assesses the availability of key budget documents, the quantity of information they provide, and the timeliness of their dissemination to citizens in order to provide reliable information on each countryÀ_À_À_s commitment to open budgeting. It is intended to provide citizens, legislators, and civil society advocates with the comprehensive and practical information needed to gauge a governmentÀ_À_À_s commitment to budget transparency and accountability. The Open Budget Index 2006 was calculated based on detailed questionnaires completed by local experts in 59 participating countries from every continent.  In 2008, based on inputs received from researchers and extensive in-house reviews, the International Budget Partnership (IBP) has made three changes in the methodology applied to its Open Budget Survey, which is the basis for the Open Budget Index (OBI). The first change concerns the timing of the release of the eight key budget documents assessed by the Survey. The second change is the inclusion of the enacted budget in calculating country scores for the OBI. The third change is based on comments received from experts from Brazil and Nigeria that resulted in revisions to the answers of a few questions used to assess these countries.
